> ephemera are just memories that didn't try hard enough. 

How does memory work?

- What kind of place 
- What sort of thing 

Different levels of time: 
- Astrological
- Natural 
- Human 

Date 

	•	2000 - event that happen in that year
	•	01/2000 - event that happen in that month/year
	•	01/01/2000 - event that happen exactly in that day/month/year
	•	2001-2005, 10/2001-02/03/2005 - event that happen within the two dates
	•	~2005 - event that happen around the time in that year
	•	2005-~ - event that happen from that year and beyond (now).

	> an idea for a brain-dead simple mobile application that allowed people to talk about what kind of place you were in and what sort of thing you were doing, rather than a hyper-specific narrative.
  
> What if instead of saying you were at a specific place with a specific address, which we didn’t know about and which you didn’t want to waste time pecking in to a mobile UI, you could just record that you were “at a bar” ? And what if the way to add meaning and nuance to that fact was to add a “feeling” to the signal.

> For example, what if you could say “I’m at a bar, crying” or “I’m in a telco, hulking out”. The list goes on. Those two statements (category plus emotion) combined with a latitude and longitude, multiplied by a lot of people, start to fill in a lot of gaps.
